        I graduated from IU and I was on my way to med school when I realized I lost my 
        dream of owning a coffee shop of my own. I grew up working in the food industry working 
        every role a restaurant could have. Honestly, my favorite role, especially at the Sip, is being a server because of all the amazing people I meet everyday.
